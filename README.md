# COT6405 Analysis of algorithms

Experiments for quizes and exercises

## Programming project

Runtime and space analysis for the
[longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
(LCS) problem.

Three algorithms are analyzed:

- Brute-force
- Dynamic programming
- Hirschberg

See [Jupyter notebok](./longest-common-subsequence/report.ipynb) and
[report derived](./longest-common-subsequence/report.pdf) from it.

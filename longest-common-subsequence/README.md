# COT 6405 Programming Project

Runtime and space analysis for the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.

Three algorithms are analyzed:

- Brute-force
- Dynamic programming
- Hirschberg

See the Python notebok and the PDF report created from it for deatils.

## How to the code

1. Install Python 3
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Delete the `data` directory to collect fresh metrics
1. Collect metrics:
    1. `./metrics.py phase1`
    1. `./metrics.py phase2`
1. Results are now cached again in `data`
1. Open the notebook to analyze the metrics
